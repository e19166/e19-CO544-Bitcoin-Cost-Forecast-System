## Introduction

### What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is like digital money we can use on the internet. It doesn’t need banks or governments to work. It’s like having our own bank in our pocket. It uses a technology called blockchain. Think of it as a digital ledger that records all transactions made with Bitcoin. These transactions are made directly between users, not through a middleman. This is what we mean by peer-to-peer. To make sure these transactions are valid, they are checked using a process called proof-of-work. People called miners do this work of checking and they get rewarded with new Bitcoins for their effort. This is how new Bitcoins are created.

So, in simple terms, Bitcoin is a type of online money that works without a bank, where all transactions are recorded on a digital ledger called blockchain.

## Problem Statement
Knowing the future price of Bitcoin is important for people who want to invest in it. If the price of Bitcoin is low, people might not want to invest in it. Instead, they might want to put their money into other things.

The prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can change a lot in a short time, which can be a problem for users. There are many factors that cause these price changes. It’s hard to solve this problem, but techniques like machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining can help.

Many researchers and developers are working on ways to predict cryptocurrency prices. Our goal is to create a system that can predict the cost of Bitcoin.

In simple terms, we’re trying to create a system that can tell us what the price of Bitcoin might be in the future. This can help people decide when to invest in Bitcoin.
